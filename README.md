This is an HTML code for a signup form that allows the user to add members to a front-end development team. The form includes a search bar that allows the user to filter through the members, as well as checkboxes for each member that the user can select to add them to the team. The form also includes a close button, which will close the form, and a "Save" button, which will submit the form and add the selected members to the team. Additionally, the form includes a "Cancel" button which will reset the form. The code also uses FontAwesome library to add icons to the form. The form uses the "formspree.io" to handle the form submission.
